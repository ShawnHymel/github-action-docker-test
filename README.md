# GitHub Action with Docker

This is a basic test repository that demonstrates how to run a Docker container (built from a custom Docker image) inside of a GitHub Actions workflow. Take a look in .github/workflows/hello-action.yml to see how the workflow is constructed.

To try this workflow out, clone this repository, make a trivial change somewhere (e.g. add a useless space to a file), and commit/push. Take a look at the Actions tab to see how the action ran.
